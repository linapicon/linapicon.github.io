		<h1>I Moved to NY and started my new dream</h1>

		<p>
          I like this country because if you really want something, you are able to work for it. I like the multiculturalism and how everybody is open to encouraging each other. The idea of working and having the ability to go to a restaurant, buy brand clothes or shoes, or even have a brand phone is drastic; I was not able to do this in my country.</p>


          <p> Now, I am here pursuing my dream in this country. I can't lie that I miss my family a lot, but at least I can help them financially. </p>


          <p> My parents traveling in EUROPE and me in the U.S.</p>
